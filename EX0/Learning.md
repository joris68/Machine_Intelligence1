Bivariate Distribution:

- a bivariate distribution is the simpliest form of a multivariate distribution (joint distribution)

- A Vector for Location parameter (mu) for the different Distributions R^k

- A Covariance Matrix R^(k x k) for the different Distributions


Random Vector:
A random vector is a group of random variables. They often represent different statistical units of a mathematical system. 
(Heigth, Age, Weight,....)


Covariance Matrix:
Is a square Matrix between and denotes the covariance for each element

Determinante:


Conditional Density:


2D Histograms or Density Heatmaps:
Is a 2D generalization of a histogram bins will be generated by an aggregation function


Marginal Distribution:
Given a random vector of dimension > 1 the marginal distribution denotes the probability densitiy of on individual component of the random vector

Joint Distribution:
Denotes the probability density of the entire random vector
